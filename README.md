    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1
) AS t1
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
## 4. Identify the Longest Movie

) AS t
WHERE director_name = 'Rajiv Chilaka';
```
## 7. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons
```sql
SELECT *

```
## 8. Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre

## 9.Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix.
```sql
SELECT 
    country,
    release_year,
    COUNT(show_id) AS total_release,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(show_id)::numeric /
        (SELECT COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100, 2
    ) AS avg_release
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY country, release_year
ORDER BY avg_release DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
## 10. List All Movies that are Documentaries
```sql
SELECT *

```
## 11. Find All Content Without a Director

```
## 12. Find How Many Movies Actor 'Salman Khan' Appeared in the Last 10 Years

```sql
SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ',')) AS actor,
    COUNT(*)

GROUP BY actor
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## 14. Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords
```sql
SELECT

    COUNT(*) AS content_count
FROM (

            WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad'
            ELSE 'Good'
